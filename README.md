# Social-Network-Simulation
This is a simulation of a social sharing network using NetLogo.

Note: this is an early version of the simulation, so for now it's not perfect, and there is yet lot of stuff to be added in future versions (e.g. more metrics, plotting, adding automatic generation of user input, etc).

## What's in the simulation:

You will need all the files to run the simulation, here's a brief description of each file:
* generate_input.py: python script for generating the necessary parameters to run the simulation (i.e. number of peers, documents and number of ticks)
* set_variables.nls: generated file by the python script containing the procedure used to initiate the global variables.
* set_variables.txt: text file used as a template to generate the global variables.
* social-network-simulation.nlogo: is the file for the NetLogo simulation (you will need to install NetLogo 5.1 to run it)
