# Social-Network-Simulation
This is a simulation of a social sharing network using NetLogo.

Note: this is an early version of the simulation, so for now it's not perfect, and there is yet lot of stuff to be added in future versions (e.g. more metrics, plotting, adding automatic generation of user input, etc).
